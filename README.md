# Ninety-Nine Scala Problems

[http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/)

I attempt to solve as many as I can from the 99 scala problems that the website list above.

The goal is to learn scala and improve my problem solving technique this is why I revisit the already solved problems to try improve the code, because hopefully in the meanwhile I get better in Scala.
